# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Users who prefer light mode get a first-class experience — every panel, the map, and all chrome look intentionally designed for light backgrounds, not like an afterthought inversion.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Theme Core, Settings Toggle

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Theme Core, Settings Toggle)
Plan: 1 of 2 (COMPLETE)
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-02-16 — 02-01 ThemeManager module and FOUC prevention complete

Progress: [█████████░] 90%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 8 min
- Total execution time: 0.77 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-css-foundation | 5/5 | 44min | 9min |
| 02-theme-core-settings-toggle | 1/2 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (5min), 01-03 (5min), 01-04 (17min), 01-05 (12min), 02-01 (2min)
- Trend: consistent (02-01 fast due to small focused scope)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Settings-only toggle to avoid cluttering dense dashboard UI
- Keep accent colors unchanged (reds, greens, yellows work on both backgrounds)
- CSS custom properties approach enables instant theme switching without reload
- (01-01) Split :root into two blocks: theme colors vs semantic colors, preventing accidental light-mode override of semantic values
- (01-01) getCSSColor uses Map cache with auto-invalidation on data-theme attribute change
- (01-02) Semantic-colored rgba tints kept hardcoded: CSS cannot parametrize rgba() individual channels with var()
- (01-02) Overlay vars for backgrounds/borders only; shadow var for box-shadow contexts only; text hierarchy vars for text color
- (01-02) High-opacity dark rgba (>0.6) maps to var(--bg), low-opacity (<0.35) maps to var(--overlay-heavy)
- (01-03) color-mix(in srgb, var(--x) N%, transparent) pattern for alpha-transparent tints from CSS variables
- (01-03) Settings window --settings-* variables alias global theme variables for cascade isolation
- (01-04) THREAT_COLORS kept as deprecated constant; new getThreatColor() function is recommended path
- (01-04) PIPELINE_COLORS and MONITOR_COLORS left as fixed hex — category identifier colors not theme-dependent
- (01-04) Map d3 SVG fills/strokes converted to --map-* CSS variables for theme reactivity
- (01-05) 15 minor gaps in 3 files (VerificationChecklist, PizzIntIndicator, MacroSignalsPanel) accepted as low-priority fallback colors
- (01-05) Map staying dark in light mode confirmed as expected — DeckGL basemap swap is Phase 3 scope
- (01-05) Phase 1 success criteria validated: all 124+ colors converted, themes separated, 20+ panels work in both themes, WCAG AA contrast met
- (02-01) Dark mode is default — FOUC script only sets data-theme when stored value is explicitly 'light'
- (02-01) applyStoredTheme() is lightweight pre-mount call: skips event dispatch and cache invalidation
- (02-01) CSP updated with unsafe-inline for script-src to allow FOUC prevention inline scripts

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- ~~124+ hardcoded color instances found via grep - must be systematically converted in Phase 1~~ (resolved: 889 colors converted in 01-02, audit completed in 01-05)
- Map basemap URL is hardcoded in DeckGLMap.ts - needs parameterization in Phase 3
- D3 charts have hardcoded color scales - require theme subscriptions in Phase 3
- Unknown if Carto light basemap ocean colors will require Deck.GL overlay adjustments

**Phase 1 Complete:**
- All CSS color centralization complete
- Light and dark themes verified working
- 15 minor gaps documented as acceptable (low-priority fallback colors)
- Ready for Phase 2 (ThemeManager implementation)
